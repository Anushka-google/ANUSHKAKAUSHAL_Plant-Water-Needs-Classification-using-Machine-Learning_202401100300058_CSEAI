This project uses machine learning to predict the water requirements of different plant species based on environmental features such as sunlight exposure, soil type, and watering frequency. By training a Random Forest Classifier on a structured dataset, the model classifies plants into water need categories (e.g., low, medium, high). 
🌿 Plant Water Needs Classification Using Machine Learning
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the water requirements of various plant species based on environmental conditions such as sunlight exposure, soil type, and watering frequency. It aims to support sustainable irrigation practices and efficient plant care.

📌 Problem Statement
Water is a critical yet finite resource, and efficient irrigation is vital for sustainable agriculture and horticulture. This project seeks to classify plants into categories—Low, Medium, or High water needs—based on specific environmental features to optimize water usage and improve plant health.

🎯 Project Goals
